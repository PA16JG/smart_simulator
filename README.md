# smart_simulator
In this project, an electrical simulator tool is developed which would automatically generate a circuit from the image of circuit which is to be simulated.
Functionalities Utilised: OpenCV; GUI(graphical user interface); to store the various templates of  circuit elements, we have used the SQLite Database; 
So basically as the user inputs an image, it is compared with pre-stored TEMPLATES, and if a template matches, its values are retrieved and stored. Further, computation of the stored values is done and results are displayed.
